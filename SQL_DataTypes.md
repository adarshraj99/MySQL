* Real : Can hold value 4 bytes in size. So, have a 7 digits of precision after decimal. It is also a float type. It is a single pricesion floting point format. While Float is Double precision floting point format. So, real can be used to save memory and float for more data precision(more memory).
* Money : It is for storing money values in data types. It is accurate to 10,000th of monetery units that they represent.  
* SmallMoney: It is accurate to 100th of the monetery unit that they represent. 

## 2. Character :
* Char : If storage is 10 and data input is 6. Char will store it in 10 storage.So, it will waste more memory spaces. 
* Varchar : Alternate to Char. It will store the data according to the data memory. So,it will not waste extra memory. 
* NChar : For storing the diffrent human languages as string values. It is of fixed length character.
* NVarChar : For storing the diffrent human languages as string values. It is of variable length character.
